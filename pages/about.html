				Who I am? My name is Nathalie Flores, I am from Costa Rica. Yeap, a country with beautiful Caribbean beaches! I am a Computer Science student and I am in my second year. The subject of programming and design are not my strengths, these are my baby steps.
			</p>
			<p class="text-white">
				I have lived in Dublin for 2 years and work as a healthcare assistant. I love riding my bike, even on rainy days I enjoy it. I am a lover of good food accompanied by friends. I enjoy traveling, reading a book and a cup of tea.
