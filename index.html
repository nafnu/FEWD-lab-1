            <p> I am struggling with every single challenge and I feel like I am dumb to the point I can’t learn anything while everyone else around is coding so easy? Do u have the same kind of thoughts? Is it normal to struggle and looking for the solution to understand how to solve it? I need always to see the videos, stop and check...</p>

                My inspiration comment every Tuesday:
                Yes, it’s absolutely normal to struggle, and if you pay very good attention to the solution and don’t quickly copy/paste code and move on, you’ll still learn a lot and make progress.
